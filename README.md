## Why The Fork()?


I took a course in Operating Systems that covered the concepts at a high level, but I also want to understand how an actual OS works under the hood. I think this project is really good for understanding that. It's only about 6000 lines of code, so I can understand each part of the OS and even make changes as I see fit. Initially, I am just studying all parts of the system, but I will make small, incremental changes along the way to test my understanding. I am also adding comments to almost every file to ensure that I understand what's actually going on.

Good series where a professor walks through all parts of the operating system and talks about the limitations and features of xv6. Here's the series: [The xv6 Kernel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWUJKH0RNFE&list=PLbtzT1TYeoMhTPzyTZboW_j7TPAnjv9XB&pp=iAQB).

## RISC-V (RVS4) Data Types


| Data Type | Bits | Bytes |
|-----------|------|-------|
| char      | 8    | 1     |
| short     | 16   | 2     |

| long      | 64   | 8     |


## Orignal README


xv6 is a re-implementation of Dennis Ritchie's and Ken Thompson's Unix
Version 6 (v6).  xv6 loosely follows the structure and style of v6,
but is implemented for a modern RISC-V multiprocessor using ANSI C.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

xv6 is inspired by John Lions's Commentary on UNIX 6th Edition (Peer
to Peer Communications; ISBN: 1-57398-013-7; 1st edition (June 14,
2000)).  See also https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.1810/, which provides
pointers to on-line resources for v6.

ERROR REPORTS

Please send errors and suggestions to Frans Kaashoek and Robert Morris
(kaashoek,rtm@mit.edu).  The main purpose of xv6 is as a teaching
operating system for MIT's 6.1810, so we are more interested in
simplifications and clarifications than new features.

BUILDING AND RUNNING XV6

You will need a RISC-V "newlib" tool chain from
https://github.com/riscv/riscv-gnu-toolchain, and qemu compiled for
riscv64-softmmu.  Once they are installed, and in your shell
search path, you can run "make qemu".
