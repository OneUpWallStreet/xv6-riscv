## scheduling-xv6-lottery

Changed the scheduler to a [lottery scheduler](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/cpu-sched-lottery.pdf) as described in the os-tep [Project 2](https://github.com/remzi-arpacidusseau/ostep-projects/tree/master/scheduling-xv6-lottery) (from Kernel Hacking). The scheduler isn’t very good at all—it feels quite unresponsive. Below is a graph of CPU ticks with the number of tickets as follows:

```
Process ID: 1, Tickets: 1, Ticks: 26
Process ID: 2, Tickets: 1, Ticks: 22
Process ID: 12, Tickets: 1, Ticks: 1
Process ID: 6, Tickets: 5, Ticks: 7136
Process ID: 8, Tickets: 10, Ticks: 14147
Process ID: 10, Tickets: 3, Ticks: 4241
```

# Old README

xv6 is a re-implementation of Dennis Ritchie's and Ken Thompson's Unix
Version 6 (v6).  xv6 loosely follows the structure and style of v6,
but is implemented for a modern RISC-V multiprocessor using ANSI C.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

xv6 is inspired by John Lions's Commentary on UNIX 6th Edition (Peer
to Peer Communications; ISBN: 1-57398-013-7; 1st edition (June 14,
2000)).  See also https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.1810/, which provides
pointers to on-line resources for v6.

locking), Cliff Frey (MP), Xiao Yu (MP), Nickolai Zeldovich, and Austin
Clements.

ERROR REPORTS

Please send errors and suggestions to Frans Kaashoek and Robert Morris
(kaashoek,rtm@mit.edu).  The main purpose of xv6 is as a teaching
operating system for MIT's 6.1810, so we are more interested in
simplifications and clarifications than new features.

BUILDING AND RUNNING XV6

You will need a RISC-V "newlib" tool chain from
https://github.com/riscv/riscv-gnu-toolchain, and qemu compiled for
riscv64-softmmu.  Once they are installed, and in your shell
search path, you can run "make qemu".
